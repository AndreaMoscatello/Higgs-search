# Higgs-search
ML model trained to detect Higgs Boson from a datasets of particles collisions at LHC.

This code is a final project for the Machine Learning exam at Stockholm University. The database used is described in the following paper: arXiv:1402.4735v2. All the credits go to the authors.

The neural network is built using TensorFlow alongside Keras and Sklearn utilities.
